* Introduction                                                        :slide:
- Data sharing is not easy

- But it is increasingly required

- And increasingly desired

            The big question is: "How do we make that happen?"

- Nobody wants more work

- We would all like to get more out of what we already do

- We are working on tools that make that happen that I will talk about today

* Why is data sharing hard today?                                     :slide:
- For many scientific authors data and analysis are not integrated into writing tools

  - Think about a manuscript in MS Word/LaTeX
  - Data in Excel, data files,...
  - Plots in Origin/SigmaPlot/etc.
  - Separate script files for analysis
  - all with limited interconnectivity

     - e.g. where is the data in Fig 2 of the manuscript?
     - Where is the file/script that did the data analysis?
     - How do I reuse the data in Table 2 for a new purpose? Copy and Paste?

- These tools are not especially well-integrated and not easily adapted to new use cases

* Sharing is tedious, error prone                                     :slide:

- Sharing then becomes extra work to generate supporting information that reconstructs the effort, copies data you think you used, etc.

- Reconstruction of the work that went into the manuscript is error prone

- and tedious...

- Reuse is not much better

- Yet increasingly required, and desired

* Our approach to this issue is integration of tools/data             :slide:

- We developed an integrated set of tools that makes data/code/analysis part of the manuscript preparation/submission process could help with data sharing

- It would leverage the work we already do in scientific writing

- and provide access to reusable data/code

- This does require development of a relatively new tool chain for writing

- We have done this in Emacs + org-mode + code

- It is all open-source (http://github.com/jkitchin/jmax) and cross-platform

* Emacs + org-mode for reproducible, functional scientific documents  :slide:
- org-mode is basically a plain text markup language deeply integrated into Emacs (an editor)

- Outline mode at the core, and much much more

* We have used it extensively in scientific publishing                :slide:
- Over dozen papers in print by my group illustrating what can be done

- cite:hallenbeck-2013-effec-o2 - all experimental
- cite:miller-2014-simul-temper - mixed experiment/computation
- cite:xu-2014-relat - computational DFT on oxides
- cite:xu-2014-probin-cover - computational coverage/site dependence
- cite:curnan-2014-effec-concen - full sql database described in SI
- cite:boes-2015-estim-bulk - exp/computation H2/D2 exchange on CuPd

- cite:kitchin-2015-examp - examples of reusing data
- cite:boes-2016-neural-networ - Molecular simulation

Let's see a working example
- cite:mehta-2015-ident-poten The data is available in the SI

- The json database described in SI file:am4059149_si_001.pdf (see Table 2 page 13)

- The source can be extracted from the PDF (goto line 336)
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
pdftk am4059149_si_001.pdf  unpack_files
#+END_SRC

That SI file was generated here (goto line 336):
file:supporting-information.org

* Reusing the data                                                    :slide:
That data is human readable - and machine addressable

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var data=supporting-information.org:TiO2-data
(remove-if-not (lambda (x) (string= "rutile" (nth 1 x))) data)
#+END_SRC

If you prefer Python, no problem. Here we get the anatase data:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :var data=supporting-information.org:TiO2-data :results value
return [x for x in data if x[1] == 'anatase']
#+END_SRC

* Automating data embedding sharing                                   :slide:
- org-mode is great - If you use org-mode
- In an [[id:9EE6959B-D9BA-48FD-A1CD-807FB6FAD50E][Appendix]] there is code that automatically embeds data and code in org-mode into HTML and PDF.
- One source to many outputs

- We can extract the source code and load it here

* What makes this integration possible?                               :slide:
- An extensible editor
  - Extensible in a full programming language
  - This allows the tool to become what you want
  - Emacs is ideal for this

- A lightweight markup language
  - to differentiate text, code, data
  - Org-mode is also ideal for this
    - Part structured markup, part api
    - Very good compromise on function and utility with authoring ease

- </code>
  Since we use code to generate and analyse data, this solution works especially well

* Concluding thoughts                                                 :slide:

- Emacs + org-mode + </code> enables a lot of very exciting capabilities in publishing and data sharing

  - Integrated narrative text, data, code

  - Export to a broad range of other formats

  - Interaction with the world (other computers, instruments) via APIs

    - Materials Project, translation, Internet of Things, ...

- The future is very exciting

- We are not waiting for someone to figure out what we want

  - Anyway, by the time they deliver it we will need something else ;)

** The custom export code \label{export-code}
Here we define a custom table exporter. We use the regular table export mechanism, but save the contents of the table as a csv file. We define exports for two backends: LaTeX and HTML. For LaTeX, we use the attachfile cite:pakin-attachfile package to embed the data file in the PDF. For HTML, we insert a link to the data file, and a data uri link to the HTML output. We store the filename of each generated table in a global variable named =*embedded-files*= so we can create a new Info metadata entry in the exported PDF.

#+name: table-format
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent :tangle data-sharing.el
(defvar *embedded-files* '()
  "List of files embedded in the output.")

(defun my-table-format (table contents info)
  (let* ((tblstart (org-element-property
		    :contents-begin table))
	 (tbl-data (save-excursion
		     (goto-char tblstart)
		     (org-babel-del-hlines
		      (org-babel-read-table))))
         (tblname (or (org-element-property :name table) (md5 (format "%s" tbl-data))))
	 (format (elt (plist-get info :back-end) 2))
	 (csv-file (concat tblname ".csv"))
	 (data-uri-data))

    ;; Here we convert the table data to a csv file
    (with-temp-file csv-file
      (loop for row in tbl-data
	    do
	    (insert
	     (mapconcat
	      (lambda (x) (format "\"%s\"" x))
	      row
	      ", " ))
	    (insert "\n"))
      (setq data-uri-data
	    (base64-encode-string
	     (buffer-string))))

    (add-to-list '*embedded-files* csv-file)

    (cond
     ;; HTML export
     ((eq format 'html)
      (concat
       (org-html-table table contents info)
       (format "<a href=\"%s\">%s</a>"
	       csv-file csv-file)
       " "
       (format (concat  "<a href=\"data:text/csv;"
                        "charset=US-ASCII;"
                        "base64,%s\">data uri</a>")
	       data-uri-data)))
     ;; LaTeX/PDF export
     ((eq format 'latex)
      (concat
       (org-latex-table table contents info)
       "\n"
       (format "%s: \\attachfile{%s}"
	       csv-file csv-file))))))
#+END_SRC

Next, we define an exporter for source blocks. We will write these to a file too, and put links to them in the exported files. We store the filename of each generated source file in a global variable named =*embedded-files*= so we can create a new Info metadata entry in the exported PDF.

#+name: src-block-format
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent :tangle data-sharing.el
(defun my-src-block-format (src-block contents info)
  "Custom export for src-blocks.
Saves code in block for embedding. Provides backend-specific
output."
  (let* ((srcname (org-element-property :name src-block))
	 (lang (org-element-property :language src-block))
	 (value (org-element-property :value src-block))
         (format (elt (plist-get info :back-end) 2))
	 (exts '(("python" . ".py")
		 ("emacs-lisp" . ".elisp")
		 ("C" . ".c")
		 ("R" . ".R")))
	 (fname (concat
		 (or srcname (md5 value))
		 (cdr (assoc lang exts))))
	 (data-uri-data))

    (with-temp-file fname
      (insert value)
      (setq data-uri-data (base64-encode-string
			   (buffer-string))))

    (add-to-list '*embedded-files* fname)

    (cond
     ;; HTML export
     ((eq format 'html)
      (concat
       (org-html-src-block src-block contents info)
       (format "<a href=\"%s\">%s</a>" fname fname)
       " "
       (format (concat "<a href=\"data:text/%s;"
                       "charset=US-ASCII;base64,"
                       "%s\">code uri</a>")
	       lang data-uri-data)))
     ;; LaTeX/PDF export
     ((eq format 'latex)
      (concat
       (org-latex-src-block src-block contents info)
       "\n"
       (format "%s: \\attachfile{%s}" fname fname))))))
#+END_SRC

Finally, we also modify the results of a code block so they will appear in a gray box and stand out from the text more clearly.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle data-sharing.el
(defun my-results (fixed-width contents info)
  "Transform a results block to make it more visible."
  (let ((results (org-element-property :results fixed-width))
	(format (elt (plist-get info :back-end) 2))
	(value (org-element-property :value fixed-width)))
    (cond
     ((eq 'latex format)
      (format "\\begin{tcolorbox}
\\begin{verbatim}
RESULTS: %s
\\end{verbatim}
\\end{tcolorbox}"
	      value))
     (t
      (format "<pre>RESULTS: %s</pre>" value)))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: my-results


An author may also choose to embed a file into their document, using the attachfile package for LaTeX. Here, we leverage the ability of org-mode to create functional links that can be exported differently for LaTeX and HTML. We will create an attachfile link, and set it up to export as a LaTeX command or as a data URI for HTML.

#+name: attachfile-link
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results none :tangle data-sharing.el
(org-add-link-type
 "attachfile"
 (lambda (path) (org-open-file path))
 ;; formatting
 (lambda (path desc format)
   (cond
    ((eq format 'html)
     ;; we want a data URI to the file name
     (let* ((content
	     (with-temp-buffer
	       (insert-file-contents path)
	       (buffer-string)))
	    (data-uri
	     (base64-encode-string
	      (encode-coding-string content 'utf-8))))
       (add-to-list '*embedded-files* path)
       (format (concat "<a href=\"data:;base64,"
                       "%s\">%s</a>")
	       data-uri
	       path)))
    ((eq format 'latex)
     ;; write out the latex command
     (add-to-list '*embedded-files* path)
     (format "\\attachfile{%s}" path)))))
#+END_SRC

Here, we define a derived backend for HTML and LaTeX export. These are identical to the standard export backends, except for the modified behavior of the table and src-block elements.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results none :tangle data-sharing.el
(org-export-define-derived-backend 'my-html 'html
  :translate-alist '((table . my-table-format)
		     (src-block . my-src-block-format)
		     (fixed-width . my-results)))

(org-export-define-derived-backend 'my-latex 'latex
  :translate-alist '((table . my-table-format)
                     (src-block . my-src-block-format)
		     (fixed-width . my-results)))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle data-sharing.el
(defun custom-export-and-open-html ()
  "Use my-html custom exporter and open the file."
  (let* ((base (file-name-nondirectory
		(file-name-sans-extension (buffer-file-name))))
	 (html (concat base ".html")))
    (save-restriction (widen)
		      (browse-url (org-export-to-file 'my-html html)))))

(defun custom-export-and-open-pdf ()
  "Use my-latex custom exporter and open pdf."
  (save-restriction
    (widen)
    (let* ((org-latex-image-default-width "")

	   (org-latex-minted-options

      (org-export-to-file 'my-latex tex)
      (ox-manuscript-latex-pdf-process tex)
